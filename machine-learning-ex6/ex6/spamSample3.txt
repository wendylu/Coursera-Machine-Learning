Dear Wendy,

I'm writing to you to see if you're intersted in an amazing deal.

You see my brother from Canada has won the lottery (for $50 million Canatwoonies) yet they won't let him claim the winnings without a small deposit. The deposit is around $100k. If you want to wire me the $100k I'll be happy to give you 5% of the winnings.

Just send me your bank account login and we'll sort things out.

Best wishes,
Tedward
